# Naruto HandSign Recognition

This is a project based on the well-known famous Japanese Animated Series "Naruto" by Masashi Kishimoto. In the animated show, there are characters referred to as "Ninja" who make a various number of hand-sign combinations as a way to utilize their abilities. This project attempts to use Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to identify what handsign an individual has made. 

## Data

The data used in this project was manually collected and augmented and collected by collecting a video from a webcam, following a number of data-augmentations such as flips and rotations to increase dataset size.
